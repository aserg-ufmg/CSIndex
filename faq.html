<!--
<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Do you plan to cover other countries?
</h6>

<p> Yes, but we cannot precise when we will do this.
Also about this question, our license
allows others to create versions for other countries.
Basically, you need to provide a list of professors (name,
DBLP PID, and university) for the candidate country.</p>

----->

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
What is your definition of a full paper?
</h6>

<p>
It is a paper presented in the main track of a conference. We also apply a
minimum page size threshold, such as:

<ul>
<li> Software Engineering, Programming Languages, Information Systems, Databases,
Web & Information Retrieval: 10 pages
<li> Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, Human-Computer Interaction: 8 pages
</ul
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Do you have plans to cover short papers (including demos, tool papers, early research
papers, industry track papers etc)?
</h6>


<p>
No, in the case of conferences, we only collect full papers, describing
mature and carefully evaluated work; these papers
should be viewed as journal-quality papers.
</p>


<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Why my paper is not listed?
</h6>

<p>
In the case of conferences, check if it is a full paper, published in the main
track of the event, in the last five years. If this the case, please
use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kz3F1fZIKtubWYiu1">form</a>
and provide data about your paper.
</p>


<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Which conferences are tracked?
</h6>

<p>
We do not intend to cover all CS conferences.  Our interest is on journal-quality
conferences, with good metrics and well-known sponsors (ACM SIGs, IEEE CS, etc).
Particularly, conferences should attend the following thresholds:
<ul>
<li> submitted > 100 papers
<li> acceptance < 30%
<li> h5-index > 20
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We also do <b>not</b> track multi-conferences, since it is not possible to
retrieve the h5-index of each of their conferences or tracks.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, we set up a limit of 15 conferences per
research area (the exception is Computer Networks, with 18 conferences;
but this area also includes Mobile Computing).
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Which journals are tracked?
</h6>

<p> First, journals must be indexed by Journal Citation Reports (JCR).
    Second, we look for journals attending the following thresholds:
<ul>
<li> h5-index > 25
</ul>
</p>

Furthermore, we set up a limit of 15 journals per research area (the exception
is Operational Research, where we are indexing 21 journals; however, this area
is the only one that does not have conferences indexed by CSIndexbr). Finally,
there is also a limit of at most two magazines per research area.

</article>

<p>
<ul>

<li> <b>Why having a limit of 15 journals per area?</b> Because our goal is
  to index only the most important venues (journals or conferences) of
  each area. To access the full list of publications of a researcher, please
  check his/her DBLP page.
<li> <b> Why JCR's impact factor is not used?</b>
  Because JCR has a restrict license; for example "sharing of JCR data
  outside a subscriber’s institution is strictly prohibited".

</ul>
</p>



<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Why conference [Conf] or [Journal] are not covered?
</h6>

<p>
We accept suggestions to track other conferences or journals. However,
please check if they attend the thresholds defined in the previous
questions.
If you think this is the case, please
use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kz3F1fZIKtubWYiu1">form</a>
to inform the metrics about [Conf] or [Journal].
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
How do you define top-conferences?
</h6>

<p>
First, top-conferences should have:

<ul>
<li> submitted > 180 papers and
<li> h5-index > 30.
</ul>

Moreover, whenever possible we define a limit of 3 top-conferences
per research area.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Why some areas have more than 3 top-conferences or journals?</b> Because
  they are a combination or include distint areas. For example, we have
  five top-conferences in Computer Networks, but it
  includes Mobile Computing, which has even a dedicated ACM SIG.

<li> <b>Why not divide an area with more than 3 top-conferences
  in areas X and Y?</b>
  Because there are journals that publish papers in X and Y.
</ul>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
How do you define top-journals?
</h6>

<p>
We define as top-journals the <i>Transactions</i> published by ACM and IEEE
Computer Society (or IEEE Computational Intelligence Society, in the case of
AI journals; or IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, in the case of
Robotics journals; or INFORMS, in the case of Operational Research).
</p>

<p>

Moreover, there is a limit of 3 top-journals
per resarch area.
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
What is the meaning of "other" in the journals Rank column (Stats tab)?
</h6>

<p> These journals are scored as conferences (weight 0.33, instead of 0.40).
  The following journals are classified in this category:
<ul>
<li> Magazines and journals that accept short papers (which must have at least 6 pages)
<li> Journals that accept more than 500 papers/year
<li> Journals with <i>normalized-h5-index</i> < 0.2
</ul>
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
How is the departments' score computed?
</h6>

<p>
Using this formula:


<ul>
<li>score = A + (0.4 * B) + (0.33 * C) <br>
</ul>

where:

<ul>
<li> A = number of papers in top-venues (journals or conferences)
<li> B = number of papers in journals
<li> C = number of papers in conferences, magazines, journals that accept
     short papers, or in "other" journals
</ul>
</p>

<!---
<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
How are citations collected?
</h6>

<p>
We collect citations using <a href="https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc">Crossref API</a>.
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a>
is an official DOI registration agency. Whenever a publisher asks
Crossref for a DOI, it must provide several metadata about the paper being
registered, such as title, authors, date of publication, etc. Publishers
can also provide the DOIs of each reference contained in the paper.
In this way, Crossref is creating a database of citations; given a DOI,
this database stores other DOIs that cite it.
</p>

<p>
Other questions related to citations:

<ul>

<li> <b>Why are you not using Google Scholar citations?</b> Because they are
  "closed"; Google’s terms of service forbids data collection by bots
  or similar programs.

<li> <b>Why the number of Crossref and Google Scholar citations do not
  match?</b>
  There are two major reasons:

  <ul>
  <li>First, because Crossref only considers citations coming from documents
  with DOIs. Therefore, citations made in books, theses, preprints,
  informal or workshop papers, etc are not considered. Interestingly, this
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05053.pdf">paper</a>
  concludes that "Google Scholar unique citations have, on average, a much
  lower scientific impact than citations also found by WoS/Scopus".</I>

  <li>The second reason is
  because  some publishers do not provide citations metadata, when registering
  papers with Crossref.
</ul>

<li> <b>Who else uses Crossref citations?</b> Users include the Cited-by service
  of many journals (Wiley, Elsevier etc), scholarly search engines (e.g.
  Digital Science's <a href="https://www.dimensions.ai/">Dimensions</a>) and
  several other scholarly communication analysis tools (see a list in this
  <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-delivery/rest-api-users/">page</a>).
</ul>
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
How often is your data updated?
</h6>

<p>
We are pushing at least one update per month (including papers,
citations, and arXiv preprints). Latest update dates are informed
at the bottom of the <a href="statistics.html">Statistics</a> page.
</p>


<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">How can I help so that CSIndexbr covers an research area X?</h6>

<p> Please, use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kz3F1fZIKtubWYiu1">form</a> to inform
basic metrics about the relevant conferences in X, in your opinion (see the required metrics
in the Stats tab).</p>


<h6>What is your definition of research area?</h6>

<p> A research area must have a Special Interest Group (Comissao Especial) at SBC or ACM.</p>



<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
What happens when an author moves from institution X to Y?
</h6>

<p>
CSIndexbr assigns all papers from an author to its current institution. Therefore,
after moving to Y, his papers are listed as belonging to Y,
even the ones produced when he was at X. The reason is that it is not trivial to
automatically keep track of the past institutions of each author in our database.
